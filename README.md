# DOTS_Assignment
 
The three features, simple movement, shooting and waves of enemies have been implemented using dots. To make things run fast and smooth I've used Burst Compile. Jobs also help but in this small scale it's not doing as much as it could. On a larger scale you could use jobs and multithreading to make things even faster and more effective.

The Player can move freely on the x and y axis using WASD. You can shoot up on the y axis using the space bar, and enemies spawn above the player and moving down the y axis.
